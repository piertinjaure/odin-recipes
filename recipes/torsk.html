        <h3> Fried Salmon with Potatoes, Melted Butter, Lemons & Cowberries</h3>
            <p>Here you have my G grandmother Margareta's infamous, one of a kind recipe that I got raised along side. It's truly something else! Do join me down this recipe, as you might just master it with how easy it is! </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
             <li>6 Salmon Fillets</li>
             <li>8 Potatoes</li>
             <li>4 Lemons</li>
             <li>5g Butter</li>
             <li>However many cowberries you see fit! (alot if you know what's up)</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>First step is to heat up 3 of your stove plates to medium temperature & have a frying pan, a cooking pot & a smaller cooking pot ready on standby. Tap up some water in the bigger of the pots</li>
                <li>Pour up some breadcrumbs on a plate</li>
                <li>Now the fun starts! Begin by filleting the salmon into decent sized fillets. Then remove any rogue bones</li>
                <li>You then proceed to handle the bone-free salmon in the breadcrumbs you prepared. Really get in there</li>
                <li>About time to put in your potatoes in the heated water</li>
                <li>Follow that up by frying your fillets</li>
                <li>Keep at it until theyre brown-golden & the kitchen smells like heaven</li>
                <li>When it's coming to a close you can put the butter in the smaller pot & melt it to a liquid</li>
                <li>Happily serve with squeezed lemon juice, cowberries for everybody & the melted butter ontop</li>
    </body>        </ol>
